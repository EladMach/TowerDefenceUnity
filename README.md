Tower Defense Game - Readme
Welcome to the Tower Defense Game! This is a small game developed in Unity where you'll be able to test your strategic skills by defending your base from waves of incoming enemies. Place your towers strategically to fend off the enemies and prevent them from reaching your base.

Gameplay Instructions:
Objective: Your main objective is to protect your base from enemy waves. If too many enemies reach your base, you'll lose the game.

Tower Placement: To place a tower, click on an empty tile within the designated tower placement zones. Different towers have varying abilities and costs, so choose wisely.

Tower Upgrades: As you defeat enemies, you'll earn currency. Use this currency to upgrade your existing towers or purchase new ones. Upgrading towers can increase their range, damage, and other attributes.

Enemy Waves: Enemies will spawn in waves and follow predetermined paths towards your base. Your towers will automatically attack enemies within their range.

Strategy: Experiment with different tower combinations and placements to find the most effective strategy for each wave. Some enemies might have specific weaknesses that certain towers can exploit.

Special Abilities: In some cases, towers might have special abilities or attacks that you can trigger manually for greater impact. Use these abilities strategically to turn the tide of battle.

Progression: As you successfully fend off waves, the enemies might become stronger and more challenging. Adapt your strategy and upgrade your towers accordingly.

Victory: The game is won when you successfully repel all enemy waves without allowing them to breach your defenses.
